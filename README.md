Loosely based on the findings by [@danneu](https://github.com/danneu/koa-skeleton)


### Setup

*NOTE: Make sure you have nodejs version 4+!*

Run the quick install

`npm install`

TODO: finish

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root, and add all process variables. Any variables added, need to be exposed through the `config.js` file.

Example:

    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=1337
